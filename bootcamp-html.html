            <div class="first box">Move me to the top right and can scroll past me</div>
            <div class="second box">Fix me to the top left and scroll with the page</div>

            <div class="first box">
                Make me just take up the entire row and have space before and after this text and the next box.
                <div class="second box">
                    Make my box just wrap<br />
                    my text and center me!
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Order these fish as per the book, "One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish".<br />
                Change the "Red Fish" to red font and "Blue Fish" to blue font.<br />
                Embolden the "Two Fish" and "Blue Fish" by only using "font-weight" once.<br />
                Align them all to the right and make sure the box fits snugly.
                
            </p>
